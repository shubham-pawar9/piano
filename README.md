Interactive Virtual Piano

The "Piano Template" project is a dynamic and interactive web application that replicates the functionality of a piano keyboard. 
This project has been implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with an engaging musical experience. 
The piano template features not only visual aesthetics but also realistic sound effects that mimic the sound of piano keys being played. 
The application responds to both mouse button clicks and keyboard key presses, making it versatile and user-friendly.

*Technology Stack:
HTML: Used for creating the basic structure and elements of the web page.
CSS: Employed for styling the visual elements, layout, and animations of the piano keys.
JavaScript: Implemented to handle user interactions, play sound effects, and manage the piano's behavior.
